<h1>Diabetes Classification Using Logistic Regression</h1>
This project demonstrates how to classify diabetes data using logistic regression in Python. The dataset used is the diabetes dataset from the scikit-learn library. The target values in this dataset are binarized to create a classification problem where the objective is to predict whether a patient's diabetes measure is greater than 140.

<h2>Steps Covered</h2>
<ul>
<li>Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn are imported for data manipulation and machine learning.</li>
<li>Loading the Dataset: The diabetes dataset is loaded, and the target values are binarized.</li>
<li>Splitting the Data: The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.</li>
<li>Training the Model: A logistic regression model is created and trained on the training data.</li>
<li>Making Predictions: The trained model makes predictions on the test data.</li>
<li>Evaluating the Model: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and a detailed classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
The evaluation metrics are printed to the console, providing insights into the model's accuracy and performance on the test data.
